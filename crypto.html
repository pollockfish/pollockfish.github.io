<h1 style="margin-top:1em;">Crypto</h1>

<h2>Getting crypto</h2>

<ul>
<li>Best bet is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, which is the most trusted (read: boomer) OTC crypto outlet in the US. 2% fee to purchase crypto with debit/credit card, so not the best choice for large investments, but not a huge deal if you&#39;re just getting your feet wet with a small purchase. 

<ul>
<li>Coinbase requires you to go through the KYC (Know-Your-Customer) process before you can buy any coins, but it&#39;s pretty straightforward: name, address, SSN, photo ID. When I signed up I was verified the same day, but your mileage may vary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting on an exchange</h2>

<h3>Choosing an exchange</h3>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase has its own exchange, <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-USD">Coinbase Pro</a>, but it doesn&#39;t have a huge amount of pairs, and the pairs they <em>do</em> have aren&#39;t all that interesting. 
<br/>
<strong>Rating:</strong> Pass.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.binance.us/en/home">Binance US</a> is one of the bigger and more popular exchanges in the States. Decent selection of pairs, but limited only to spot trading &amp; doesn&#39;t offer leverage. Their reputation is a little spotty, though, and apparently their customer service sucks. 
<br/>
<strong>Rating:</strong> Eh. Doesn&#39;t really bring enough to the table to compensate for their questionable trustworthiness.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a> is also a big US exchange; their reputation is solid and they&#39;re one of the only places that explicitly allows US citizens to trade on margin for some pairs. They also have futures trading. Lacks some of the more fun shitcoin pairs, though, which puts a damper on the true &ldquo;crypto degenerate&rdquo; experience. 
<br/>
<strong>Rating:</strong> Good pick for larger portfolios.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kucoin.com/">Kucoin</a> &lt;- This place is my jam. Up to 10x margin trading, huge selection of pairs (including hard-to-find shitcoins), lending, staking, futures, the whole nine yards. Fees are average. Probably not a place to put or keep large sums of money, but certainly a fun place to goof off and get the hang of trading crypto. 
<br/>
<strong>Rating:</strong> Super fun. Comes off as a little unscrupulous, even though I haven't had any issues yet. My personal favorite, so far, especially for experimenting with trading set-ups with small amounts.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT KUCOIN:</em> Don&#39;t attempt to do the KYC on Kucoin. They pretend not to serve US citizens, so if you tell them you&#39;re in the US, they&#39;ll freeze your ability to trade and force you to withdraw all your coins. Good news is, the only real limitation on people who haven&#39;t done the KYC is that you can <em>only</em> withdraw 2 BTC per day (not kidding).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving money to an exchange</h3>

<p>The way I get funds into an exchange is as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>Buy either <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/litecoin">LTC</a> or <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/tezos">XTZ</a> on Coinbase. Both are cheap to send and will get cleared by exchanges rather quickly. Click Send/Receive on that coin&#39;s page.</li>
<li>Go to your exchange, find the &ldquo;Deposit&rdquo; page, choose &ldquo;Crypto&rdquo; as your deposit method, and copy the wallet address that&#39;s given for that coin. </li>

<p>Quick note: <strong>Be extremely careful when sending crypto between wallets!</strong> If you screw up and send coins to the wrong address, or send coins to a wallet that doesn&#39;t support that coin, it&#39;s pretty much gone. Be vigilant and always double check that you copied the right address.</p>

<li>Finally, go back to Coinbase, paste the address into the form, and send it off.</li>
<li>Wait for the funds to clear on the blockchain. Can take some time, so don&#39;t get too nervous if it doesn&#39;t show up immediately on the exchange. When I deposit XTZ to an exchange, it typically takes around half an hour to get all the confirmations necessary to release the funds for trading.</li>
<li>That&#39;s it! Knock yourself out.</li>
</ol>
